  Will_Paginate is extremely confusing which most likely means it is easy.

  Pagination is hard to set up in the way that I have formatted my redux.

  Finally found a way to get pagination to work with my redux setup
    (It is a mix bewteen links and infinite scroll).
  Added rating images to the beers, that is done randomly, so every time
    a new batch of beers is shown all ratings change.

  Fixing bugs and displays
7:20PM Stop Coding

I wish I had more time to work through some styling and bugs, but everything is
functional and hopefully won't breakdown. This was a good assignment to get the
feel of Postman, it was a mystery before this assignment.
